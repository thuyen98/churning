## Data Churning
Churn, also known as customer churn, is a crucial metric for businesses aiming to grow. It indicates the number of customers who have discontinued using a product or service within a specific timeframe.
## Some Definition
* Price sensitivity refers to how much demand fluctuates when the price of a product or service changes.
* Price elasticity of demand measures the variation in consumption of a product in response to a change in its price.
* Random forest is a supervised learning algorithm that requires a set of features and the target outcome, such as churn. It predicts outcomes by constructing multiple decision trees on various data samples and using a majority vote to determine the final prediction.
